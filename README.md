# Spiderball

A Python web scraping tool that crawls with the agility of a spider and the power of a python.

## Project Overview

Spiderball is a web scraping tool designed to:

1. Log in to websites that need a username and password
2. Crawl (i.e., visit) the target web pages
3. Isolate the primary content from each web page (like Safari's Reader View)
4. Clean up the isolated HTML, convert to Markdown, and save to file
5. Organize the Markdown files to mirror the directory structure as the original website

## About the Name

The name Spiderball pays homage to the Spider Ball Python, a beautiful and unique morph of the Ball Python (Python regius). These remarkable creatures, known for their intricate web-like patterns, unfortunately now suffer from congenital health issues &mdash; a consequence of selective breeding practices.

Recognizing the ethical concerns, the International Herpetological Society has banned the sale of spider morphs (also known as Spider Royal Pythons). This situation serves as a poignant reminder of the complexities and responsibilities involved in animal breeding.

When using this software, let's think about the power we hold, both online and in the real world. It's our responsibility to use this power wisely. Let's be kind to others and think beyond ourselves - striving to benefit and care for all living beings, while safeguarding all that we can within our sphere of influence. Whether it's data on the web or other living creatures, let's embrace our role as thoughtful stewards of this world.
